When the project file of cricket score sheet project is executed, it works by following the steps described below:

   * First of all the project displays the welcome screen and the screen fades up to display the main menu.

   * The main menu comprises three options namely:
    -> New Score Sheet
    -> View Score Sheet
    -> Exit

   * If ‘1’ is entered, Cricket Score Sheet project asks for the name of new score sheet. When the file is created, a message is displayed on the screen.

   * Then, the score sheet appears on screen in which the user has to input the following information:

    Competition
    Venue
    Match between and versus
    Toss winner team
    Elected choice of toss winner
    Inning and date
    Name of batsman and run hit by each of them
    Name of bowler and run given by each blower

  * After inputting these data, the program asks user to input ‘e’ to edit the data and ‘c’ to continue.

  * If the user inputs ‘2’ in the main menu, the program asks for the name of file. If the file is found, it is displayed. Otherwise, error message is printed on the screen.

  * The third option in main menu is exit. If ‘3’ is entered in the main menu, the Cricket Score Sheet project terminates.
